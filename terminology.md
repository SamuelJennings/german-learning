# Terminology

Most native English speakers use grammar correctly without ever thinking about it. They might not be able to explain the rules, but they’ve absorbed them naturally through years of speaking, listening, and reading. Maybe you learned some grammar terms in school, but chances are you haven’t needed to use them much in everyday life — and that’s completely normal.

If you’re reading this book, you’ve made the decision to learn German — whether out of curiosity, personal challenge, or practical need. No matter your reason, it’s important to get comfortable with the specific terminology used when speaking about grammar. These terms help explain how language works, and they come up often in this guide and in other resources. Don’t worry if some of them feel unfamiliar at first—this section will walk you through the essentials.
