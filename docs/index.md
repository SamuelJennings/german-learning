# Introduction

<!-- The *Open German Guidebook" is an open document written by German learners for German learners. It is a collection of notes, grammar rules, and examples that can help you learn the German language. It aims to clearly and simply outline and explain the things you need to know at each stage of your learning journey. -->

<!-- This guidebook began as a way to document my own language learning experience and solidify my understanding of the German language. I chose to write it in the style of a guidebook based on the Feynman Technique which involves 4 steps:

1. **Choose a concept** you want to understand.
2. **Teach it to a child** (or imagine doing so), using simple language and analogies.
3. **Identify gaps** in your explanation—these are the areas where your understanding is weak.
4. **Go back and study** those weak areas, then refine your explanation.

The idea being that clarity in your own mind is reflected in your ability to communicate clearly. If you rely on jargon or abstract terms, it may be a sign that you haven’t fully grasped the idea yourself. -->
