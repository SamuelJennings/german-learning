# Nebensätze

**Nebensätze** (Subordinate Clauses) are dependent clauses that cannot stand alone as a sentence. They are introduced by a connector word (**subordinating conjunction**) that connects the main clause (Hauptsatz) with the subordinate clause (Nebensatz). The connector word is placed at the beginning of the subordinate clause.

Nebensätze serve different functions in a sentence, such as expressing reasons, conditions, time, purpose, or contrast. Understanding and using Nebensätze correctly is essential for constructing complex sentences and conveying precise meanings in German.

At the B1 level, the focus is on expressing **contrast**, **cause and effect**
