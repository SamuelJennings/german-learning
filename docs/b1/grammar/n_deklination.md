# N-Deklination

# Understanding the N-Declension (N-Deklination) in German

The **N-declension** (German: *N-Deklination*) refers to a group of **masculine nouns** in German that add **-n** or **-en** to their base form in all cases **except the nominative singular**. This declension pattern is an important exception to standard noun declension in German and must be memorized.

## 📌 Key Characteristics

- Only **masculine nouns** are affected.
- They **add -n or -en** in the **accusative**, **dative**, and **genitive** cases (singular).
- The **plural** always ends in **-n or -en** (even in the nominative).
- The **nominative singular** is the only case without the extra ending.

1. **Male persons or animals ending in -e**

    - der Junge (boy)
    - der Name (name)\*
    - der Kollege (colleague)
    - der Affe (monkey)

## ⚠️ Special Notes

- Even if the noun ends in -e (like *Junge*), it may not follow N-declension unless it refers to a **male person or animal**.
- Feminine and neuter nouns **do not** follow N-declension.
- Proper use of N-declension is important for formal writing and exams like the **TestDaF** or **Goethe-Zertifikat**.

## 🧠 Tips for Learning

- Memorize common N-declension nouns as vocabulary items.
- Practice with declension tables.
- Read example sentences to reinforce context.
- Be alert when using **der**, **den**, **dem**, and **des**—these signal the need for N-declension.

## ✅ Summary

If you see a **masculine noun referring to a person or animal**, or one ending in **-ent, -ist, -at**, etc., **check if it follows the N-declension**. In those cases, remember to add **-n or -en** in every case **except** the nominative singular.
