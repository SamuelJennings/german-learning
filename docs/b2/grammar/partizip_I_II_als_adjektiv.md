# **Partizip I and II as Adjectives in German**

In German, **Partizip I** and **Partizip II** can both function as adjectives. When used this way, they describe nouns just like regular adjectives and **must be declined** according to gender, case, and number.

## **What is Partizip I?** *(Present Participle)*

**Partizip I** is formed by adding **-d** to the verb stem (infinitive form). It describes an **ongoing or active** action (like "-ing" forms in English).

**Formation:**

- machen → machend
- laufen → laufend
- singen → singend

**As an adjective:**  
It is declined like any other adjective.

**Examples:**

- ein **schlafendes** Kind *(a sleeping child)*
- eine **brennende** Kerze *(a burning candle)*
- ein **funktionierender** Motor *(a functioning motor)*

## **What is Partizip II?** *(Past Participle)*

**Partizip II** is usually used to build the perfect tense, but it can also function as an adjective. It describes a **completed or passive** action (like past participles in English).

**Formation:**  
Most verbs form their Partizip II with **ge-** + stem + **-t** or have irregular forms.

**Examples:**

- gekocht → das **gekochte** Essen *(the cooked food)*
- geschlossen → die **geschlossene** Tür *(the closed door)*
- gebrochen → ein **gebrochener** Arm *(a broken arm)*

## **Partizip I vs. Partizip II**

The key difference:

- **Partizip I** → describes what is **happening now** (active)
- **Partizip II** → describes what **has happened** (passive)

**Example with "rasen" (to race):**

- ein **rasendes** Auto = a car that is currently speeding
- ein **gerastes** Auto = a car that has sped (rare in usage)

**Example with "trinken" (to drink):**

- ein **trinkender** Mann = a man who is drinking
- eine **getrunkene** Flasche = a bottle that has been drunk
