# Relative Clauses with **"wer"**

In German, **"wer"** is used to form **indefinite relative clauses**, similar to **"whoever"**, **"he/she who"**, or **"anyone who"** in English. It combines the meaning of both the antecedent and the relative pronoun into one word and **always refers to an unspecified or unknown subject**.

These clauses use **"wer"** as the subject (or sometimes object), and are typically followed by a **verb** and then a **main clause** separated by a comma.
