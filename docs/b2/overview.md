## Learning Focus

The emphasis at this level shifts from basic comprehension and expression to:

- **Expanding vocabulary**, especially with more nuanced or topic-specific terms (e.g., politics, culture, science).

- **Mastering complex grammar structures**, such as:
    - Passive voice
    - Subjunctive II (Konjunktiv II ‚Äì hypothetical statements and polite requests)
    - Relative clauses with varying cases
    - Advanced word order, especially in subordinate clauses

- **Improving coherence** and **cohesion** in writing and speaking, including the use of linking words and idiomatic expressions.

- **Developing argumentation skills**, such as expressing opinions, agreeing/disagreeing diplomatically, and summarizing points of view.

- **Understanding regional variations** in spoken German, including dialect and formal vs. informal language use.
