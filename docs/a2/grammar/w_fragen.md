# W-Fragen mit Präposition

In German, many verbs, adjectives, and nouns are linked to specific prepositions. When you want to ask a question about the **object of a preposition**, you need to include the right **preposition in the question** — just like you often do in English. Without the correct preposition, the question might not make sense at all. For example,

- ✅ *What are you waiting **for**?*
- ❌ *What are you waiting **about**?* (doesn't make sense)

Or in German,

- ✅ *Wor**auf** wartest du?*
- ❌ *Wor**über** wartest du?* (doesn't make sense)

Makes sense, right? Use the correct preposition to ask the right question!

```{note}
Sometimes, as in English, there are multiple "correct" prepositions for a given verb that will slightly (or meaningfully), change the meaning of the quesiton. Make sure you learn the different prepositions that go with each verb.
```

## Forming questions with prepositions

The question "What are you waiting **for**?" in English is very open and could warrant a variety of answers. If we know that the person we are talking to is waiting for *someone*, we might swap "what" with "who" in order to get the information we are looking for ("*Who* are you waiting for?"). This clarity in our question indicates to the other person exactly what type of response they should provide.

German speakers also want this clarity in their questions. However, it's not as easy as simply swapping out the question word at the beginning.

### Asking about **things**

When you ask about **objects, situations, or ideas**, use the prefix **wo\(r\)** (replaces the English "what") plus the preposition.

**Examples**

| Verb + Preposition | Question | Translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| warten **auf** | **Worauf** wartest du? | What are you waiting for? |
| denken **an** | **Woran** denkst du? | What are you thinking about? |
| sprechen **über** | **Worüber** sprecht ihr? | What are you talking about? |
| sich freuen **auf** | **Worauf** freust du dich? | What are you looking forward to? |
| sich interessieren **für** | **Wofür** interessierst du dich? | What are you interested in? |

```{note}
If the preposition starts with a vowel (*an*, *auf*, *über*), you insert an **-r-** between *wo* and the preposition: **woran**, **worauf**, **worüber**. Why? Because it just sounds better!

    Generate 10 English sentences that include a question about an object introduced by a verb-preposition combination. Each question should be convertible to a German question using "wo(r)-" constructions like "Worauf wartest du?" or "Womit schreibst du?". Use a mix of accusative and dative prepositions. The sentences should be appropriate for A2-level learners.

### Asking about **people**

When asking about people, we don't use the above form. Instead we start with the **preposition** and then add the correct form of the word "who" depending on the preposition.

- **wen** (accusative)
- **wem** (dative)

**Examples**

| Verb + Preposition | Question | Translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| warten **auf** | **Auf wen** wartest du? | Who are you waiting for? |
| denken **an** | **An wen** denkst du? | Who are you thinking about? |
| sprechen **mit** | **Mit wem** sprichst du? | Who are you speaking with? |
| wohnen **bei** | **Bei wem** wohnst du? | Who are you staying with? |
| sich bedanken **bei** | **Bei wem** bedankst du dich? | Who are you thanking? |

```{note}
**Accusative or Dative?**

A small number of prepositions always take the *Akkusativ* case and a small number always take the *Dativ* case. Unfortunately, many prepositions can be used with *either* "Akkusativ" or "Dativ" so you will just have to become familiar with these in different situations and context over time. You can try to memorize as much as possible, however, I find the best way to learn is to practice with the verbs and their prepositions in context.

## Summary

- Ask about things/ideas, use *wo\(r\)+preposition* (Woran denkst du?)
- Ask about people, use **preposition + wen/wem** (An wen denkst du?)
- The preposition determines the case of the pronoun (wen/wem)
- Some prepositions always take the accusative or dative case, while others can take either depending on the context.
- Practice with the verbs and their prepositions in context to learn them better.

    Generate 10 English sentences that involve common German verb + preposition combinations. Include a mix of sentences that ask about things (requiring "wo(r)- + preposition") and people (requiring "preposition + wen/wem"). The sentences should be phrased as questions and suitable for A2-level learners. Then, translate each sentence into German using the correct W-Frage form and indicate whether it uses "wo(r)-" or "preposition + wen/wem". Example: What are you waiting for? → Worauf wartest du? (wo(r)-); Who are you speaking with? → Mit wem sprichst du? (preposition + wem)
