# Pronouns

Besides the personal pronouns, there are other pronouns in German that are used to refer to people or things in a more general way. Here are some of the most common ones:

| Pronoun | Meaning | Example Sentence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **man** | One, people, they (general) | **Man kann hier parken.** <br> (One can park here.) |
| **jemand** | Someone, somebody | **Jemand hat an der Tür geklopft.** <br> (Someone knocked at the door.) |
| **niemand** | No one, nobody | **Niemand weiß, wo er ist.** <br> (Nobody knows where he is.) |
| **alles** | Everything, all | **Alles ist gut.** <br> (Everything is fine.) |
| **etwas** | Something, a little | **Ich habe etwas zu trinken.** <br> (I have something to drink.) |
| **nichts** | Nothing | **Nichts funktioniert.** <br> (Nothing works.) |
