# Indirect Questions

An **indirect question** is a question that is embedded within a statement or another question. In English, we use indirect questions often, especially when we want to sound polite or express uncertainty. For example:

- I don’t know **where she is**.
- Can you tell me **what time it is**?
- He asked **whether it was raining**.

German uses indirect questions in the same way. These are useful when reporting a question, expressing uncertainty, or being polite.

## Forming indirect questions

Indirect questions are a subordinate clause (**Nebensatz**). That means they follow the standard Nebensatz word order, where the **conjugated verb goes to the end** of the clause.

To form an indirect question that requires a yes/no answer, use *"ob"* (if/whether). For example:

1. **Ich weiß nicht, ob er kommt.**
    (I don’t know whether he is coming.)
2. **Kannst du mir sagen, ob du morgen Zeit hast?**
    (Can you tell me if you have time tomorrow?)
3. **Er fragt, ob sie die Prüfung bestanden hat.**  
    (He asks if she passed the exam.)

For all other questions, use the **question word** (W-Frage) at the beginning of the indirect question. For example:

1. **Ich weiß nicht, wo er wohnt.**  
    (I don’t know where he lives.)
2. **Kannst du mir sagen, wie spät es ist?**  
    (Can you tell me what time it is?)
3. **Sie fragt, wann der Zug ankommt.**
    (She asks when the train arrives.)
4. **Er erklärt, warum er zu spät ist.**
    (He explains why he is late.)
5. **Wir wissen nicht, was sie meint.**  
    (We don’t know what she means.)

## Summary

- Indirect questions are subordinate clauses (Nebensätze).
- They use question words (W-Frage) or **ob** for yes/no questions.
- The verb in the indirect question goes to the end.
- They are useful for expressing uncertainty, politeness, and reporting speech.

:::{practice}
Generate 10 example sentences in English that require indirect questions in German. The sentences should be suitable for A2-level learners and should use a variety of W-Frage words (e.g., where, when, why, how, what, who, which) as well as “ob” for yes/no questions. The sentences should be short and simple, suitable for learners who are still becoming familiar with indirect questions. The sentences should cover a range of question types, including both W-questions and yes/no questions. Provide clear examples using both the present and past tense where appropriate.
