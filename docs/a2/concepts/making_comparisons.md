# Comparing things

Making comparisons is a vital aspect of everyday conversations. It allows you to express preferences, highlight differences, and make decisions. Whether in personal or professional settings, comparisons often arise when discussing options, experiences, or opinions (e.g., “This movie is better than the last one” or “I prefer coffee to tea”). Learning how to do this in German will allow you to participate more freely in conversations with German friends and colleagues.

We can compare things in three main ways:

1. **Comparisons of difference** – *better than*, *more expensive than*, *faster than*, etc.

    - *This car is faster than that one.*
    - *She is more intelligent than her brother.*

2. **Superlatives** – *the most*, *the least*, *the best*, etc.

    - *She is the best student in the class.*
    - *This is the most expensive car in the showroom.*

3. **Statements of equality** – *the same*, *as ... as***, etc.

    - *This movie is as good as the book.*
    - *He is as tall as his father.*

## Comparisons of difference

We use the German "Komparativ" to compare two things that are differenct. It is used frequently in everyday conversations — whether you're comparing food, people, prices, or experiences. It’s a useful structure to master early!

To form the German "Komparativ", follow this structure:

> **{noun}`[Thing A]` {verb}`[Verb]` {adj}`[Adjektiv]` als {noun}`[Thing B]`.**

### Adjective endings

- For most **short adjectives**, add **-er** to the end.

    - *klein* → *klein**er*** (small → smaller)
    - *schnell* → *schnell**er*** (fast → faster)

- If the adjective has an **a, o, or u**, it often gets an **Umlaut (ä, ö, ü)** in the comparative:

    - *kalt* → *k**ä**lter* (cold → colder)
    - *groß* → *gr**ö**ßer* (big → bigger)

- If the adjective is **long or ends in -el/-er**, just add **-er** (and sometimes drop an 'e'):

    - *teuer* → *teurer* (expensive → more expensive)

### Examples

1. Dieses Handy ist {adj}`billig**er**` als mein altes.  
*This phone is cheaper than my old one.*  

2. **Im Sommer ist es {adj}`w**ä**rm**er**` als im Winter.**  
*In summer, it’s warmer than in winter.*  

3. **Mein Bruder ist {adj}`gr**ö**ß**er**` als ich.**  
*My brother is taller than me.*  

4. **Ich finde Mathe {adj}`interessant**er**` als Geschichte.**  
*I find math more interesting than history.*  

5. **Du bist schneller als ich im Laufen.**  
*You are faster than me at running.*  

6. **Der Film war spannender als das Buch.**  
*The movie was more exciting than the book.*  

7. **Heute ist es kälter als gestern.**  
*Today is colder than yesterday.*

    Generate 10 example sentences in English for someone learning German at an A2 level. The sentences should focus on making comparisons using 'als' in German. The sentences should be simple, clear, and include comparisons such as 'bigger than,' 'faster than,' 'more expensive than,' etc. Each sentence should involve a comparison of two things or people. For example: 'My house is bigger than yours.
```

## Superlative

The German "Superlativ" is used to say that someone or something has the *most* of a quality — like *the best*, *the fastest*, *the cheapest*, or *the most beautiful*. The "Superlativ" helps you express strong opinions and describe extremes, which is something you will do more and more as an A2 learner,

There are two common ways to form the Superlativ depending on whether the adjective comes before a noun or stands alone. 


<!-- ### **A. With a Definite Article (Der/Die/Das) + “-ste(n)”** -->
**1. Adjective before a noun**

> **{noun}`[Thing A]` ist der/die/das + Adjektiv** **+ -ste/-sten** {noun}`[Kategorie]`.

If the adjective comes before a noun, then it requires a special ending:

- *schnell* → *der schnell**ste*** (the fastest)
- *klug* → *die klüg**ste*** (the smartest – with Umlaut)
- *Das ist der schnell**ste** Zug.* (That is the fastest train.)

**2. Standalone adjective**

This is used when there is **no noun** after the adjective:

> **{noun}`[Thing A]` ist am + Adjektiv + -sten.**

- *Er läuft **am** schnell**sten**.* (He runs the fastest.)
- *Das schmeckt **am** be**sten**.* (That tastes best.)

```{note}

<!-- Some adjectives use an **Umlaut** in the Superlativ (just like in Komparativ):

- *kalt → am kältesten*
- *groß → am größten* -->

If an adjective ends in **-d, -t, -s, -ß, -sch, -z**, you often add an **extra 'e'** before **-sten**. This generally makes the word a bit easier to pronounce:

- *interessant → am interessantesten*
- *kalt → am kältesten*
```

### Examples

1. **Das ist der teuerste Laptop im Geschäft.**  
*That’s the most expensive laptop in the store.*  

2. **Sie ist die beste Spielerin im Team.**  
*She is the best player on the team.*  

3. **Heute war der heißeste Tag des Jahres.**  
*Today was the hottest day of the year.*  

4. **Mein kleiner Bruder ist am lustigsten.**  
*My little brother is the funniest.*  

5. **Er fährt am schnellsten von allen.**  
*He drives the fastest of all.*  

6. **Ich finde Pizza am leckersten.**  
*I find pizza the tastiest.*  

7. **Das war der langweiligste Film, den ich je gesehen habe.**  
*That was the most boring film I’ve ever seen.*

    Generate 10 example sentences in English for someone learning German at an A2 level. The sentences should focus on using the Superlative in German. Include a mix of sentences where the Superlative adjective is placed before a noun (e.g., 'the tallest mountain') and sentences where the Superlative is used as a standalone adjective (e.g., 'the best'). The sentences should be simple and clear, using common adjectives such as 'biggest,' 'fastest,' 'most expensive,' etc. For example: 'This is the most beautiful painting.
```

## Equality

(Gleichheitsvergleich)

When you want to say that two things are the same in some quality — for example, “as fast as,” or “as tasty as” — you use **statements of equality**. In German, this is typically done using the construction **„so … wie“**.

TO form a statement of equality, use the following structure:

> **so + {adj}`[adjective/adverb]` + wie**

This means: **"as {adj}`[...]` as"**

### Examples

1. **Mein Bruder ist so groß wie ich.**  
→ My brother is as tall as I am.

2. **Deutsch ist so interessant wie Englisch.**  
→ German is as interesting as English.

3. **Sie tanzt so gut wie er.**  
→ She dances as well as he does.

4. **Das neue Auto ist so schnell wie das alte.**  
→ The new car is as fast as the old one.

5. **Ich bin heute so müde wie gestern.**  
→ I’m as tired today as I was yesterday.

### Adding emphasis

Sometimes, you really need to stress that two things are *exactly* the same. In English, we might say *"just as good as"* or *"exactly the same as."* In German, we achieve this same effect using **"genauso"** instead of **"so"**.

> **genauso + [adjective/adverb] + wie**

**Examples**

- **Er ist genauso freundlich wie sein Bruder.**  
→ He is *just as* friendly as his brother.

- **Der Film war genauso spannend wie das Buch.**  
→ The movie was *just as* exciting as the book.

Both **"so … wie"** and **"genauso … wie"** are correct and natural. Use *genauso* when you want to highlight or reinforce the equality.

The sentences should be simple and clear, with examples like 'She is as tall as he is' or 'This book is just as interesting as that one.' For example: 'My car is as fast as yours.
```

| **Superlativ** | Das ist das schnell*ste* Auto. / Das Auto ist **am** schnell*sten*. |

Practice everything together by copying the following prompt into ChatGPT:

    Generate 10 example sentences in English for someone learning German at an A2 level. The sentences should cover three concepts: Comparisons using 'als' (e.g., 'My house is bigger than yours'). The Superlative (e.g., 'This is the best pizza in town'), including a mix of adjectives used before nouns and standalone adjectives. Statements of equality using 'so... wie' and 'genauso... wie' (e.g., 'She is as tall as he is,' 'This book is just as interesting as that one'). The sentences should be simple, clear, and cover a variety of adjectives and structures, making sure there is a good balance between all three concepts.
